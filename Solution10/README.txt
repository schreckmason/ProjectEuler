This is the solution to Project Euler problem 10

Building upon earlier prime problems, I think 4 and 7

Steps
	1. sudo pip install sympy (if you don't have pip, [sudo easy_install pip] first)
	2. build a list of all of the prime numbers from 1 to two million using sympy's primerange function
	3. lastly use a built-in sum function from python to sum the resulting list
