Steps to solution of Project Euler problem number 3

1. pip install sympy -- library to use sympy.isprime which determines a prime number and returns a boolean (not sympy.prime(N) which returns Nth prime number in std enum)

2. To not reinvent the wheel just use sympy.factorint(N) to list prime factors of N
