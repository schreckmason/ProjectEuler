This is the solution for problem 40 from Project Euler

Steps:
	1. Define a stringify function that will append numbers until the length of the resulting string is 100000 characters long
		a. note that at the end of this stringify function, just turn the resulting string into a list and store this globally
	2. Define a calculate_indices function that will go and fetch the specific value at any number of given indices and do the math

Note: stringify function isn't a a great approach but *shrug*
