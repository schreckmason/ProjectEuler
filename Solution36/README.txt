Solution to problem 36

Steps:
	1. Retrieved the function is_palindrome that I had previously written for solution 4
	2. Define a function base_conv_palsearch, originally was misleadingly named as just a converter however this does the check for a palindrome
	3. Define a control loop to limit the search to the first 1M numbers
