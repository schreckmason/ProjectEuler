In this repository are my one-off attempts at each of the problems from the mathematical challenge website projecteuler.net

Note that none of these solutions are deemed efficient, and have not been iterated upon, most will contain comments that were used in debugging, however I am making the effort to detail my thought
process in a README in each solution directory.
