This is the solution to problem number 25 from Project Euler

Steps: 
	1. Originally wrote the fibonacci sequence calculations as a recursive function however this was very ineffecient once n got sufficiently large
	2. Then took an iterative approach which saved a lot of execution time
	3. Trial and error until I found a sufficiently large n
