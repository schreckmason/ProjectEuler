This is the solution for problem 34 from Project Euler

Steps: 
	1. write a function split_num that splits a number into its indices
	2. write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number
	3. define a comparison function that will compare the sum of the factorial of each digit of a number with the value of the number itself
	4. lastly define the control loop of a function that starts at 3 (since 1 and 2 are false positives) and keep track of all True occurrences of comp
