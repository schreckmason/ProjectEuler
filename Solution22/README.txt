This is the solution to problem 22

Steps:
	1. Create a dictionary for letter values which will still allow for fast execution since we will always have the key to the dictionary
	2. define a function to calculate the score of a name
	3. define a function to read the contents of a file into a list and then sort that list alphabetically
	4. perform the math to multiply the name score by the index+1 (since list is zero-indexed)
